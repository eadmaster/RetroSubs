# RetroSubs

Render subtitles in old retro games based on memory context.

Can be used for:
 
 - Fan translations
 - In-game guides/tips
 - Additional OSDs
 
The current implementation is based on SHA-1 memory hashes stored in Markdown files.
 
Text appeareance can be customized to fit the game native UI.

Currently only [Bizhawk](https://tasvideos.org/Bizhawk) is supported, since it is the only emulator providing a [`memory.hash_region` Lua function](https://tasvideos.org/Bizhawk/LuaFunctions).
